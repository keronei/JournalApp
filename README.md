# JournalApp
This app allows users to pen down their thoughts and feelings and update them at any other time.

It simplified the user interface by using the basic controls to perfom operations that would have otherwise required too 
many components
this includes - back button/onDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled saves changes to notes
Swiping a note entry to the left deletes it(User is presented with a confirmation dialog)
User can login with their usual Gmail accounts.
Tapping on any note opens the details and one can make changes immediatelly...with no worry on whether they are saved or not.
Notes are ordered according to their creation time but last edited date is available for every note, this simplifies the
task to remember when one did something on their journals.
